# Logger Setup Summary

## ‚úÖ What Was Done

I've successfully set up a JUCE-based file logger for the dumumub-0000006 plugin. Here's what was implemented:

### Files Created

1. **`source/Logger.h`** - Logger header with singleton pattern and convenience macros
2. **`source/Logger.cpp`** - Logger implementation using `juce::FileLogger`
3. **`docs/LOGGER.md`** - Complete documentation for using the logger
4. **`logs/.gitkeep`** - Keeps the logs directory in version control

### Files Modified

1. **`source/PluginProcessor.cpp`** - Integrated logger initialization and added example logging
2. **`source/Canvas.cpp`** - Fixed include and added example logging
3. **`.gitignore`** - Added logs directory and .log files to be ignored

## üìÅ Log Location

The log file will be created at:
```
/Users/hughbuntine/Desktop/DUMUMUB/DUMUMUB PLUGINS/dumumub-0000006/logs/dumumub-0000006.log
```

The `logs/` directory is now in your project folder, making it easy to access and review logs during development.

**Fresh logs on every run:** The log file is automatically cleared each time the app starts, giving you a clean log for each session.

## üöÄ How to Use

### Basic Usage

Include the logger in any source file:
```cpp
#include "Logger.h"
```

Then use the convenient macros:
```cpp
LOG_INFO("This is an info message");
LOG_WARNING("This is a warning");
LOG_ERROR("This is an error");
LOG_MESSAGE("This is a general message");
```

### Example Usage

The logger is already integrated and logging:
- Plugin construction and destruction
- Audio preparation with sample rate and buffer size
- Editor creation
- Canvas creation and spawn point management

## üìù Log Format

Logs include timestamps and severity levels:
```
[INFO] Plugin initialized
[WARNING] Buffer size exceeds recommended limit
[ERROR] Failed to allocate memory
```

## üîç Current Implementation

The logger currently logs:

**PluginProcessor:**
- Construction: "PluginProcessor constructed"
- Destruction: "PluginProcessor destroyed"
- Audio prep: "prepareToPlay called - Sample Rate: X Hz, Buffer Size: Y samples"
- Editor creation: "Creating plugin editor"

**Canvas:**
- Construction: "Canvas created"
- Destruction: "Canvas destroyed - had X spawn points"
- Spawn point creation with coordinates
- Warnings for max spawn points reached or invalid bounds

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- **Singleton Pattern** - One logger instance throughout the application
- **Thread-Safe** - JUCE's FileLogger is thread-safe
- **Automatic Timestamps** - Each log entry is timestamped by JUCE
- **Multiple Log Levels** - INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and general messages
- **Auto-initialization** - Logger starts automatically with the plugin
- **Auto-cleanup** - Logger shuts down automatically when plugin closes

## üìñ Documentation

For complete documentation, see: **`docs/LOGGER.md`**

## ‚úÖ Build Status

The project builds successfully with the logger integrated. All changes have been compiled and tested.

## üéØ Next Steps

You can now:
1. Run the plugin and check `logs/dumumub-0000006.log` for output
2. Add logging to other components (SpawnPoint, PluginEditor, etc.)
3. Use the logging macros throughout your codebase for debugging
4. Monitor the log file in real-time: `tail -f logs/dumumub-0000006.log`

## üí° Tips

- Avoid excessive logging in `processBlock()` to prevent performance issues
- Use `LOG_INFO` for general information
- Use `LOG_WARNING` for non-critical issues
- Use `LOG_ERROR` for critical errors
- The log file path is accessible via `Logger::getInstance().getLogFilePath()`

Happy debugging! üêõ
